							<h1i>Is Free Trade Bad for America?</h1i>
							<h4>March 23, 2017</h4>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/TrumpTrade.jpeg" alt="Trump has one approach to trade" style="width:60%;height:60%;" /></span>
							<p style="font-size:11px;">(image taken from Bloomberg Businessweek Europe, available <a href="https://www.pressreader.com/bahrain/bloomberg-businessweek-europe/20160711/282462823250841">here</a>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like to start my posts with a motivating picture.</p>
<p>This cartoon from Bloomberg fittingly depicts how Trump wants to trade with other countries:  He basically wants to kick them out of America.  Trump says that American workers are losing their jobs because they are being outsourced to other countries like Mexico and China.</p>
<p>Let's think of a basic case: steel.  Production of steel is cheaper in China, rather than the US.  Because of open trade policies, Chinese steel can make its way to the US and still come out cheaper than steel produced in America.  As a result, consumers that prefer to buy cheaper will choose to buy Chinese steel, at the expense of American steelworkers.</p>
<p>So if you've been reading Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html">repealing TPP</a> (Trans-Pacific Partnership) and <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/23/trump-to-sign-executive-order-to-renegotiate-nafta-and-intent-to-leave-tpp.html">NAFTA</a> (North-American Free Trade Agreement), that's essentially his point.  There are a lot of products that one can think of wherein the common American worker is losing its edge: car production, garments,  electronics, etc.  If Mr. Trump promised to bring back jobs to America, then he must "kill the competition."</p>
<p>To be fair, there have been times when these free trade agreements with America have been abused.  For instance, some countries build manufacturing plants in Mexico, and in turn uses <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/08/chinese-co-shipped-aluminum-through-mexico-to-evade-tariffs-us-rivals-claim.html">Mexico's NAFTA agreement with the US in order to circumvent quotas</a>.  And if there is one thing that Mr. Trump hates, it is being outsmarted.</p>
<p>But in any case, Trump's view on trade is this: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>That globalization yields unfair trade agreements at the expense of Americans.  Essentially, that's what's causing income inequality in America.</strong> </span> The richest Americans (the 1%) are pulling away at an exponential rate while the common worker (whose jobs are lost or threatened due to outsourcing) is left behind.</p>
<p>I was asked to investigate whether this claim is justified.</p>
<p>To do this, I wanted to define what Globalization is, because globalization can mean anything these days.  So I define Globalization into one of three things:</p>
<p> Globalization by trade, or opening up one's borders to competition for goods and services.  Imagine how the US allows Japanese-manufactured cars to be sold in America. 
<p> Globalization by finance, or restrictions on the flow of money in and out of the economy.  For instance, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36575755"> India now allows 100% foreign ownership in the airline and defense industries</a> as a means of attracting more investments to their economy.
<p> Lastly, Globalization by migration, or how domestic labor markets are opened up for overseas workers. A textbook case would be the Middle East, which adopted an open labor market policy to attract foreign-born workers.  Migrants offer a supply of highly-educated, highly skilled workers that domestic resources may not be sufficient, or matched, to fill.
<p> I created the visualization below to investigate the link between globalization and income equality.  The viz can be played every decade, beginning in 1980. The left panel tracks the movement of each country group: Advanced, Emerging, and Low-Income economies; the right panel is a more disaggregated approach where you can follow the path of a particular country.  The size of the bubbles indicate wealth: Wealthier countries have bigger bubbles and poorer countries have smaller.<p>
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1490305441337' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='How does globalization affect income and inequality across countries?

<p> The results of the viz suggest that different country groups have different responses to globalization.  Generally speaking, low-income economies globalize at the expense of an equal society. It seems like the more they open their economy, the more dichotomized their society is.  Meanwhile, emerging economies have the opposite experience.  It seems like globalization, by income, finance, or migration, is linked to a more equal society for them.  Perhaps income is more equally distributed in their society as the effects of globalization is more even-handed in these countries.  What is surprising, is that in advanced economies, globalization does not seem to greatly impact income inequality.  By playing the viz, it can be seen that the economy tends to be more open through time, but the level of income inequality remains at a relatively constant level. <p>
